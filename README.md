## 🚀 Deployment Modes

> Lumen supports deployments in Docker, Kubernetes, Helm/Terraform and provides guides for major cloud providers.
> Detailed deployment guides found [here](https://docs.lumen.app/deployment/overview).

Lumen supports two separate deployment options: standard and lite.

#### Lumen Lite

The Lite mode can be thought of as a lightweight Chat UI. It requires less resources (under 1GB memory) and runs a less complex stack.
It is great for users who want to test out Lumen quickly or for teams who are only interested in the Chat UI and Agents functionalities.

#### Standard Lumen

The complete feature set of Lumen which is recommended for serious users and larger teams. Additional components not included in Lite mode:
- Vector + Keyword index for RAG.
- Background containers to run job queues and workers for syncing knowledge from connectors.
- AI model inference servers to run deep learning models used during indexing and inference.
- Performance optimizations for large scale use via in memory cache (Redis) and blob store (MinIO).

- 🛡️ Role Based Access Control: RBAC for sensitive resources like access to agents, actions, etc.
- 📊 Analytics: Usage graphs broken down by teams, LLMs, or agents.
- 🕵️ Query History: Audit usage to ensure safe adoption of AI in your organization.
- 💻 Custom code: Run custom code to remove PII, reject sensitive queries, or to run custom analysis.
- 🎨 Whitelabeling: Customize the look and feel of Lumen with custom naming, icons, banners, and more.
